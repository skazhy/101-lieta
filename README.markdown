Installation
===
Download latest [Google App Engine SDK for Python](http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python) and run the app server on src folder. You must make a copy of settings-sample.py as settings.py and fill the system variables. 

Features
===
Currently it is very minimalistic (just the basic functionality that I need), adding tasks, logs and editing them. I may add some more stuff later, but I am pretty lazy, so don't get _too_ excited :D

Usage
===
Currently it supports markdown.py for log entries. If you wish to use it, feel free to modify the code, and let me know about your modifications, so I can add them to the master branch.
Also, text in main page and info page is written directly into templates.
