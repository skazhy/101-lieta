Installation
===
Download latest [Google App Engine SDK for Python](http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python) and run the app server on src folder. That's it!

Features
===
Currently it is very minimalistic (just the basic functionality that I need), adding tasks, logs and editing them. I may add some more stuff later, but I am pretty lazy, so don't get _too_ excited :D

Usage
===
Currently there is no rich text editing support in the admin panel, so you'll have to use HTML tags. If you wish to use it, feel free to modify the code, and let me know about your modifications, so I can add them to the master branch.
Also, text in main page and info page is written directly into templates.
